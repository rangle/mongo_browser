Simple but powerful tool for managing mongodb databases

Install the gem:

    gem install mongo_browser

## Usage

Run the application

    mongo_browser

Application will be available by default at http://localhost:5678
In order to run it on custom port number pass the `--port` option with selected port.

## Running specs

The main goal of this project is to achieve the highest testability with 100% code coverage. 

### Running backend specs

All specs are running against isolated mongodb instance and the primary local database won't be affected.
See [https://github.com/lucassus/mongo_browser/blob/master/spec/support/mongod.rb](https://github.com/lucassus/mongo_browser/blob/master/spec/support/mongod.rb) helper class for more details.

In order to execute rspec scenarios for backend just execute:

    rspec spec

### Running frontend specs

#### Inside the console

* `./script/ci_javascript` will execute jasmine specs
* `./script/ci_e2e` will execute angularjs e2e scenarios

#### Inside the browser

Run thin in the test environment:

     thin start -R config-e2e.ru -e test -p 3001

Navigate to the one of the following url:

* [http://localhost:3001/jasmine](http://localhost:3001/jasmine) will execute jasmine specs
* [http://localhost:3001/e2e](http://localhost:3001/e2e) will execute angularjs e2e scenarios

### Continuous integration

All specs (backend + frontend) could be executed with the following command `./script/ci_all`
